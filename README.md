# Basicode
Project developed by Dutch computer enthusiasts in the 80s to run BASIC programs on various home computers.

The purpose of this repository is to document Basicode and my implementations on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and QL microcomputers, which were written in 1984-1987. See the <a href="https://github.com/janbredenbeek/Basicode/wiki">wiki section</a> for background information.

<a href="https://github.com/robhagemans/basicode">Rob Hagemans</a> has also created an excellent repository on Basicode with many application programs distributed over the years. You can run these on his <a href="https://github.com/robhagemans/pcbasic">PC-BASIC</a> BASIC interpreter.
