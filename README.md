# Basicode
Project developed by Dutch hobbyists in the 80s to run BASIC programs on various home computers

The purpose of this repository is to document Basicode and my implementations on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and QL microcomputers, which were written in 1984-1987. See the wiki section for background information.
